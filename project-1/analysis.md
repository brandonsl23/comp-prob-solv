# Analysis of Phase Diagrams and the Adsorption Behavior of Nitrogen and Hydrogen Under Different Conditions.

## Analysis of Phase Diagrams and Lattice with Implications

1. Ideal Mixture of Nitrogen and Hydrogen: 
![Ideal Mixture of Nitrogen and Hydrogen](/project-1/graphs/phase_diagram_ideal_mixture.png "Ideal Mixture of Nitrogen and Hydrogen")

* Nitrogen and Hydrogen Coverage: Both nitrogen and hydrogen display moderate coverage levels across a range of chemical potentials, but neither reaches full coverage. This suggests that adsorption energies are balanced, with neither species strongly favoring adsorption.
* Total Coverage: The total coverage remains below 50%, indicating that the lattice is not fully occupied even under ideal mixing conditions.
* Implications: In an ideal mixture scenario, nitrogen and hydrogen co-adsorb without significant interactions. For ammonia synthesis, this setup may allow both gases to coexist on the surface, although without any driving force for increased coverage, the probability of interaction is low.

2. Repulsive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen:
![Repulsive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen](/project-1/graphs/phase_diagram_repulsive_interactions.png "Repulsive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen")

* Nitrogen and Hydrogen Coverage: Both species show lower coverage than in the Ideal Mixture scenario, with very little coverage. The repulsive interactions between nitrogen and hydrogen reduce the likelihood of co-adsorption, causing each atom to avoid regions where the other is present.
* Total Coverage: The total coverage remains low, indicating that the lattice is sparsely populated when both species are present.
* Implications: Repulsive interactions lead to reduced adsorption for both nitrogen and hydrogen, limiting their coexistence on the surface. This configuration is unfavorable for ammonia synthesis, as nitrogen and hydrogen are spatially separated, reducing the chances of reaction.

3. Attractive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen:
![Attractive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen](/project-1/graphs/phase_diagram_attractive_interactions.png  "Attractive Interactions between Nitrogen and Hydrogen")

* Nitrogen and Hydrogen Coverage: Under attractive interactions, nitrogen and hydrogen both achieve higher coverage levels, especially at lower temperatures. This indicates a cooperative effect, where the presence of one species promotes the adsorption of the other.
* Total Coverage: The total coverage approaches 100% , suggesting that the lattice is nearly fully occupied when both gases are present, creating an environment conducive to interaction.
* Implications: Attractive interactions increase the likelihood of co-adsorption, providing favorable conditions for nitrogen and hydrogen to interact on the surface. This scenario is beneficial for ammonia synthesis, as it maximizes the probability of reaction by maintaining high coverage of both gases.

4. Immiscible Nitrogen and Hydrogen: 
![Immiscible Nitrogen and Hydrogen](/project-1/graphs/phase_diagram_immiscible.png "Immiscible Nitrogen and Hydrogen")

* Nitrogen and Hydrogen Coverage: Nitrogen and hydrogen exhibit high coverage individually, but they occupy separate regions of the lattice. This separation is due to immiscibility, where the presence of one species discourages adsorption of the other in adjacent sites.
* Total Coverage: Although the total coverage is high, it consists of isolated regions of nitrogen and hydrogen rather than a uniform distribution.
* Implications: Immiscibility hinders direct interaction between nitrogen and hydrogen by maintaining spatial separation. This setup is unfavorable for ammonia synthesis, as the lack of proximity reduces the likelihood of interaction and reaction between the gases.

* “Like Dissolves Unlike” Scenario: 
![“Like Dissolves Unlike” Scenario](/project-1/graphs/phase_diagram_like_dissolves_unlike.png "“Like Dissolves Unlike” Scenario")

* Nitrogen and Hydrogen Coverage: Hydrogen achieves higher coverage than nitrogen, with nitrogen coverage remaining very low. This suggests that hydrogen adsorbs preferentially, and nitrogen adsorption is inhibited.
* Total Coverage: The total coverage is dominated by hydrogen, with nitrogen making a minimal contribution.
* Implications: In a “Like Dissolves Unlike” scenario, the selective adsorption of hydrogen reduces the presence of nitrogen, leading to an imbalance. For ammonia synthesis, this condition is suboptimal as it limits the availability of nitrogen for reaction with hydrogen.

## Discussion of Nitrogen and Hydrogen Adsorption 
### Nitrogen Adsorption Trends 

* Nitrogen shows varying levels of adsorption depending on the interaction scenario and conditions (temperature and chemical potential). In the Ideal Mixture and Repulsive Interactions scenarios, nitrogen maintains moderate to low coverage, indicating weak adsorption affinity in these cases. In the Attractive Interactions scenario, nitrogen achieves higher coverage due to cooperative adsorption with hydrogen. However, in the Like Dissolves Unlike scenario, nitrogen coverage remains minimal as the system favors hydrogen adsorption instead.
* Observed Phenomena Explanation: Nitrogen’s adsorption is limited by its interaction energy with hydrogen and with itself. In scenarios where nitrogen is repelled by hydrogen or has no significant attraction, adsorption is low. Attractive interactions between nitrogen and hydrogen increase nitrogen's adsorption by lowering the system’s free energy when both species are present on the surface.
Hydrogen Adsorption Trends (6 Points)

* Hydrogen displays a preference for adsorption in most scenarios, often achieving higher coverage than nitrogen. In the Like Dissolves Unlike and Attractive Interactions scenarios, hydrogen reaches significant coverage, suggesting a strong affinity for the surface. Under Repulsive Interactions and Immiscible conditions, hydrogen’s coverage is lower and sometimes limited to isolated regions.
* Observed Phenomena Explanation: Hydrogen’s higher affinity for adsorption is likely due to favorable adsorption energies and smaller size, which allows it to more readily populate lattice sites. Attractive interactions between hydrogen and nitrogen further encourage hydrogen adsorption by stabilizing co-adsorption. In contrast, repulsive and immiscible interactions restrict hydrogen adsorption, limiting the spatial proximity to nitrogen.


## Adsorption Under Different Conditions
* Temperature Effects: Higher temperatures generally reduce coverage as they promote desorption, decreasing the occupancy of both nitrogen and hydrogen on the lattice. This is particularly evident in cases like the Ideal Mixture. 
* Chemical Potential Effects: Increasing the chemical potential (e.g., moving from mu_A =− 0.2 eV to 0 eV) enhances adsorption for both species, especially in scenarios like Attractive Interactions, where adsorption is cooperative.



## Implications for Ammonia Synthesis Process
The ammonia synthesis process benefits from conditions where nitrogen and hydrogen are in close proximity on the catalyst surface, maximizing the chance of interaction. Based on the diagrams:

* Attractive Interactions is the most favorable condition, as it promotes co-adsorption and increases the probability of nitrogen-hydrogen interactions.
* Immiscible and Repulsive Interactions are less favorable due to spatial separation, which reduces the likelihood of reaction.
* Like Dissolves Unlike and Ideal Mixture conditions show some potential but do not sufficiently promote co-adsorption or high coverage of both gases.

## Suggested Strategies for Optimizing Reaction Conditions
* Catalyst Design: Develop catalysts that induce attractive interactions between nitrogen and hydrogen, facilitating co-adsorption and enhancing surface interactions.
* Control Chemical Potentials: Adjust the chemical potentials to achieve balanced, moderate coverage of both nitrogen and hydrogen, ensuring both species are available for reaction without dominating the lattice.
* Optimize Temperature: Maintain temperatures that favor adsorption without excessive desorption, creating an environment where both nitrogen and hydrogen are present and mobile enough to interact.
