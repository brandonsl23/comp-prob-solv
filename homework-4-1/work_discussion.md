# Discussion: Work Done in Isothermal vs. Adiabatic Expansion

## Isothermal Expansion
The work computed for the isothermal process was higher compared to the adiabatic process for the same volume change.This is because, in an isothermal expansion, the gas is allowed to exchange heat with its surroundings to maintain a constant temperature. As a result, the system absorbs heat to perform more work during the expansion.
When looking at the graphs, the curve for the isothermal process is less steep, indicating that the work increases more slowly compared to the adiabatic process as the volume increases.

## Adiabtic Expansion 
In contrast, the work done during the adiabatic expansion is lower for the same volume change. In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, and the work is done entirely by the internal energy of the gas. This causes the gas to cool as it expands, resulting in less work.
When comparing graphs, the curve for the adiabatic process is steeper, indicating that the work done decreases more rapidly with increasing volume.
