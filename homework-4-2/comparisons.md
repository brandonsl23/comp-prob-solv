# Comparison of Thermodynamic Properties for Ce3+ 

## 1. Internal Energy (U) vs. Temperature

Isolated Ce3+:
The internal energy remains constant at zero across the entire temperature range. This is expected since, in the isolated case, all states have zero energy and no temperature dependence.

Ce3+ with SOC:
The internal energy decreases as temperature increases. This is due to the increasing population of the higher-energy 2F7/2 state as temperature rises, lowering the overall internal energy of the system.

Ce3+ with SOC & CFS:
The internal energy decreases even more significantly than in the SOC case. This is because crystal field splitting further splits the energy levels, allowing for more energy states to be accessed as temperature increases, resulting in a steeper decrease in internal energy.


## 2. Free Energy (F) vs. Temperature

Isolated Ce3+:
The free energy decreases linearly with temperature. Since the partition function remains constant for this case, the free energy is directly proportional to temperature.

Ce3+ with SOC:
The free energy decreases at a slower rate than in the isolated case. As the population of the higher-energy 2F7/2 state increases with temperature, the partition function increases, which moderates the decline in free energy.

Ce3+ with SOC & CFS:
Similar to the SOC case but with an even slower rate of decrease. The additional splitting caused by crystal field effects allows the system to access even more states, further moderating the decline in free energy.


## 3. Entropy (S) vs. Temperature
Isolated Ce3+:
The entropy remains constant, indicating that there is no change in the distribution of accessible states. This makes sense, as the 14 degenerate states remain equally populated across the temperature range.

Ce3+ with SOC:
The entropy increases with temperature, reflecting the system's ability to access more states, like the higher-energy 2F7/2 level, as temperature increases.

Ce3+ with SOC & CFS:
The entropy shows an even sharper increase at lower temperatures and then levels off as temperature rises. This is due to the greater splitting of energy levels by crystal field effects, which allows the system to access a wider range of states. As temperature increases further, the system reaches a point where most states are already populated, causing the entropy to level off.
